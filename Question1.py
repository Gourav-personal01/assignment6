# Classes are the Blueprints which have all properties and suitable Method and can used by a object.
# objects are created to use classes and objects can access all the desired properties and that blueprint which classes have create.
# Both Class and objects are Very essentials in the Object oriented Programming because it provide ease of writing multiple lines of code.

#Example - 

class class1:
    def func1(self):
        print("Hello this is test Function")

obj = class1()
obj.func1()
